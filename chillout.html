<h1>Rest &amp; Relaxation @ Basic Space</h1>
<h2>Music</h2>
<h2>Lounge Room</h2>
<p>Make yourself at home. Kick up your feet. Where there's room to lounge around; do! Feel free to ask for a wake up nudge if you think you might <em>rest</em> through something appointment</p>
<h2>Couches & beanbags & hammocks; oh, my!</h2>
<p>As BasicSpace grows, so will its creature comforts. But for now, what you see is what you get.</p>
