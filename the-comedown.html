<h2>Friday, Saturday, Saturday & Sunday</h2>
<p>Every Thursday, Friday & Saturday nights BasicSpace hosts <strong>The Comedown</strong></p>
<p>The Comedown starts at 2am the morning after the night, kicking off closer to 12 midnight in bad weather. The Comedown usually goes until sunrise, at which point it's time for yoga and breakfast.</p>
<h2>Hydration & Electrolites</h2>
<p>We have water on tap, and the salts of the earth aplenty: so drink and be merry; for a <em>good</em> Comedown is well hydrated.</p>
<h2>Technology Go Away Now</h2>
<p>The projects of the day gone by are moved aside to make room to crash. Charge your phones and give them some hard earned rest as well. No-one will mind if you fall asleep, but if you pass out and stop breathing, we <em>will</em> call an ambulance for you. We're just looking out for you is all.</p>
<h2>Warmdown; not second wind</h2>
<p>No BYO &amp; no illicit substances in BasicSpace; but feel free to face the elements, we will welcome you on your return.</p>
<h2>We want swings</h2>
<p>Help BasicSpace raise money to lobby &amp; erect a set of swings in the nearby park. Life is less alive without swings. Any amount will help, that shrapnel weighing you down? Then I think it's time to take a shot at the Tower-of-power(cords).</p>
<h2>Know thy substance</h2>
<p>Did you know that alcohol is one of the few drugs from which the withdrawel symptoms alone can literally kill you? Most people don't know the full extent of the effect what they put in their body. At BasicSpace we subscribe to a derivitave philosophy based on <a href="http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/druginfo/fact_sheets/harm_minimisation1/harm_minimisation1.html">harm minimisation</a>, and if you have a question, we want to help you find the answer.</p>
<h2>Know thyself</h2>
<p>Meditation is the bomb, and The Comedown is heavily influenced by Buddist culture. Taoism, and it's practice of mindfulness meditation, is one of the most pleasant ways to stay The Comedown. Ambient &amp; mid-tempo electronica gives The Comedown it's steady pace, it's winding down atmosphere. Back to a velocity with which one could rest. Write a poem, or a story, draw a picture, or compose a song; it's up to you. Join us for The Comedown next time you're out.</p>
