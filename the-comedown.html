heading: The Comedown @ BasicSpace

<h2>Friday, Saturday, Saturday & Sunday</h2>
<p>Every Thursday, Friday & Saturday nights BasicSpace hosts <strong>The Comedown</strong></p>
<p>The Comedown starts at 2am the morning after the night, kicking off closer to 12 midnight in bad weather. The Comedown usually goes until sunrise, at which point it's time for yoga and breakfast.</p>
<h2>Hydration & Electrolites</h2>
<p>We have water on tap, and the salts of the earth aplenty: so drink and be merry; for a <em>good</em> Comedown is well hydrated.</p>
<h2>Technology Go Away Now</h2>
<p>The projects of the day gone by are moved aside to make room to crash. Charge your phones and give them some hard earned rest as well. No-one will mind if you fall asleep, but if you pass out and stop breathing, we <em>will</em> call an ambulance for you. We're just looking out for you is all.</p>
<h2>Warmdown; not second wind</h2>
<p>No BYO &amp; no illicit substances in BasicSpace; but feel free to face the elements, we will welcome you on your return.</p>
<h2>We want swings</h2>
<p>Help BasicSpace raise money to lobby &amp; erect a set of swings in the nearby park. Life is less alive without swings. Any amount will help, that shrapnel weighing you down? Then I think it's time to take a shot at the Tower-of-power(cords).</p>
