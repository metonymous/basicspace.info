<h3>Rediscovering the lost art of play</h3>
<p>At basic space, we think <em>play is a timeless activity</em> that gets no way enough love. If there was one word which would some up how you should think about Basic Space, it's "play".</p>
<p><em>What type of play?</em> I'm glad you asked! Let me list some o' the ways.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Jam with strangers, practice turn-tabling, DJ a set, show off your latest compositions. Whatever you want to do musically, if it fits in Basic Space, come and play away. We're always keen to here new music, and have the equipment to play it loud.</p>
<h3>Hardware Hackery</h3>
<p>We have most of the tools you need to start hacking on all those hardware mods and projects you'be been putting off. Want to fix that buzzing loudspeaker? Or how about soldering together that adapter you've always wanted? Got a computer and you don't know what's wrong but wanna fix it?</p>
<p>Bring in your projects; if it's fits in Basic Space, it's welcome.</p>

<h3>Real Life Games</h3>
<p>UNO? Scrabble? Monopoly? Or perhaps a game of cards? Maybe you want to learn how to play backgammon but have never gotten around to it? Or maybe a session of twister, but you can't find enough people willing to play?</p>
<p>Some games we already have, and you're welcome to bring your own. Again, if theirs room, bring it in!</p>

<h2><strike>Work</strike></h2>
<p>Why not work? Well, of course you're free to do your work in Basic Space. But if it <em>feels</em> like work, perhaps you would rather do something else?</p>
<p>Putting out the bins is work. Work is a chore.</p>
