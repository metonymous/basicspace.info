heading: What <em>is</em> BasicSpace?
---
<p>Simply put, Basic Space is <strong>a community venue for <a title="technophile (noun) a person who is enthusiastic about technology">technophiles</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Broadly put, Basic Space is where you can <strong>play, learn, teach & share</strong>. Space to hack on projects. Space to rubber-room ideas. Space to listen to the music. Space to chill and hang out. Basically.</p>
<p>Founded by university graduates who wish they'd been dropouts, Basic Space was created for  <strong>what formal institutions don't teach</strong>; what a community of creative, intelligent people (in a suitable environment) will naturally share and learn together.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Space heralds back to the "real life forums"</strong>; space for people to discuss what they felt was important, what they were enthusiastic about. Space for people to learn from the masters in their fields, where people went to voice their latest insight. Space for people to play with knowledge and hypothetical.</p>
<p>Did you know <strong>Melbourne was founded without a "public square" as <a title="convinced that public squares only encouraged democracy Governor Gipps (who presided over the planning of Melbourne) demanded that no towns laid out during his term of office should have them included within their boundaries" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Square,_Melbourne#History_and_development">they were thought to encourage democracy</a></strong>? Federation Square is a good start, but public spaces should be the norm - not the exception.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Space for communal learning</strong>. Want to learn to program? Or put together a computer? Who better to teach it than someone who loves programming or computer hardware? People who are passionate for a language, technology, or idea, have vested interest in teaching their craft accurately and honestly. And what better way to learn more about your own knowledge gaps, than by explaining it to someone else?</p>
<p><strong>Basic Space for software hacking</strong>. Always wanted to contribute to that open source project, but didn't know how to start? Got a project that you want to get started but just need somewhere to do it? What about that project you got halfway through then got stuck? Sometimes a difference space can be just the impetus one needs.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Space for hardware hacking</strong>. Got a loudspeaker that crackles and you want to fix it? Got an computer that won't turn on and you don't know why? Or how about those headphones that are only broken because the cable broke, but you don't own a soldering iron, or just haven't got around to it? Basic Space to hack on the projects you've always wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Space, also, for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)" title="wetware is used to describe the embodiment of the concepts of the physical construct known as the central nervous system (CNS) and the mental construct known as the human mind">wetware</a> hackers; for life hackers</strong> - people who want to change themselves and other people. Hackers of thought, ideas, knowledge. Basic Space to even just read a book.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Space discourages traditional use of earbuds and headphones</strong>, although we appreciate they do have a role (as do other sensory isolation devices, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_disco">silent disco</a> FTW). So why is that? Well, <strong>Basic Space is an <a title="aka "don't shhhh me, shhh a push pop"">"open air" environment</a></strong>, because humans are not only completely capable of being fully productive with ambient conversations, multiple sources of music, a breeze ruffling their notepad & the occasional direct question - but we argue that they are happier. It can be argued that this environment would make you less productive (by certain specific formal metrics) but we argue that even if <a href="i.e. productivity on one task, usually chosen by your superiour">specific productivity</a> was reduced be 50% (or more), that the increase in health, happiness and community justify the offset. <strong>After all, what's the hurry</strong>?</p>
