<h2>Legalese & Caveats</h2>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>Limited Liability</p>
<p>Law abiding citizens. Don't break the law. We're serious. That includes copyright infringement. If you think the law is broken? Then take the appropriate measures to try to get it changed: don't break it at Basic Space.</p>
<p>You're responsible for your own belongings. We can't keep track of everyone's stuff all the time, so anything you bring is your responsibility. Owner onus applies. Check out <a href="/memberships">the memberships page</a>, specifically <a href="/memberships#storage">the storage options</a> for details on storing your belongings in Basic Space in your absence.</p>
<p>Belongings left after hours become communal unless previously arranged with Basic Space management.</p>
<p>Respect others and their belongings. If you break someone else's stuff (including Basic Space's), you are obliged to replace it. Basic Space management will enforce this policy, however discussing arrangements with the owner is encouraged.</p>
<p>We have a 3 strikes you're out policy for most non serious but unwelcome behaviour. First strike and you're out for serious offences (anything which breaches the law).</p>
<p>We log and monitor internet usage. We use this data to control usage, but <em>we respect your privacy</em>, and no-one other than Basic Space management will ever have access to the data. Short of a court order. Your logs are deletable at your request presuming they are no longer needed. If you're serious about privacy, you should research encryption and other privacy and anonymity strategies (eg. TOR, SSL, PGP, GPG, SSH, RSA etc.).</p>
