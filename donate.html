<h2>Computer Hardware</h2>
<p>Literally any computer hardware. We'll put it to use, or responsibly recycle it; either way, we all win.</p>
<p>Especially desired are old LCD monitors, of any size, shape or configuration. We <em>might</em> even pay for them (possibly).</p>
<h2>Old phones and Chargers</h2>
<p>Saddle up and bring em down. You don't need them no more? Throw them into the space</p>
<h2>Couches & Mattresses</h2>
<p>We want your old loungables. We have car. We have trailer. You have couch? Can haz couch? We have couch.</p>
<h2>Vintage Gaming Hardware</h2>
<p>It doesn't matter if it doesn't work, bring it in! Chances are it can be restored and relive it's glory days.</p>
<h2>Money?</h2>
<p>We don't know what to do with money other than waste it; if you really want to make a financial contribution, <a href="/join">membership</a> is a great way to show your support. Besides, who doesn't want an SSH relay in USA; or StockHolm; in a nuclear bunker. Also consider donating your time, as your time is most likely <em>worth</em> money, any time you spend teaching and helping others becomes your temporal donation.</p>
<h2>Tools, Cables & Periphenalia</h2>
<p>Spair hex screwdriver now that you've bought a spanking new set? Upgraded your soldering iron making the old one redundant? BasicSpace can make great use of basic tools such as crimpers, RJ45 adapters, DIN cables, power adapters; all that stuff you see at JayCar and the old Dick Smith's that to you is either broken headphones or a dud cable: to BasicSpace is the basic clay of cyberpottery.</p>
