<h1>Progressive Electro</h1>
<p>Melbourne's newest electro disc spinners tear up the bitstreams during the BasicSpace Day Sessions.</p>
<h2>Looking to perform?</h2>
<p>If you're a budding DJ looking to get some preliminary gigs, <a href="mailto:music@basicspace.info?subject=I%20wanna%20be%20a%DJ">shoot us an email</a> listing:
	<ul>
		<li>What type of music do you perform?</li>
		<li>How long is your typical set?</li>
		<li>Can your sets be recorded and replayed and/or made available for download?</li>
		<li>How much space do you need?</li>
		<li>How many power points do you need?</li>
		<li>What equipment don't you have that you need?</li>
		<li>What times you would most like to perform during?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We are looking for resident DJ's to fill our day slots: 10am&mdash;7pm Monday&mdash;Thursday. These will most likely be allocated in multiples of 1 hour (eg. 10&mdash;11, 11&mdash;1, 1&mdash;3, 3&mdash;7) of which your set should go for the majority.</p>
	<p>The genres we are looking for for the day sessions are minimal, ambient, ambient psy, psy trance, progressive psy, DnB, chillout, dubstep, electro house, funky house, tech house, tribal house, (<em>some</em>) lounge - in general anything with a constant beat, heavy bass &amp; background feel. If you're not quite sure where your music fits, go to the <a href="http://www.di.fm/" title="Digitally Imported - addictive electronic music">digitally imported website</a>, and listen to any station without vocals or trance in the title. What we don't want is songs with heavy vocals or intensive synth-pads; these types of music are extremely difficult to talk over, and we would like conversation to continue to flow at normal talking volume during your set. If you're heavily into vocal trance (or other vocal/trance centric genre) you might be interested in doing one of our <a href="/silent-disco">Silent Disco</a> sets.
	<p>BasicSpace is a not-for-profit organisation so the day sets are volunteer work: i.e. you don't get paid. You are welcome, however, to promote yourself during your sets, and to ask for donations. Our <a href="/silent-disco">Silent Disco</a> &amp; <a href="/the-comedown">Comedown</a> sets <em>are</em> paid, so think of the day sets as experience.</p>
